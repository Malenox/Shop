* `React Router DOM`: Handles client-side routing, enabling navigation between different views within the application.

* `Axios`: A powerful promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests to interact with backend services.

* `React Hook Form`: Simplifies form management and validation, offering a performant and flexible solution for user input.

* `Sass`: Utilized for writing more maintainable and organized CSS, offering features like variables, nesting, and mixins.
